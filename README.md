# Berline-Airbnb

A great project for beginner's as well experienced people for getting updated, and becoming perfect in the knowldge about data analyis using the skills they have.

Berline Airbnb:
Here i have used python as an scripting language for analysis 

I have choosed python because thats the easiest programming language according to me 
 1)as it facilitate the learners to target the concept on which they are working on, rather than remaining of syntax like (main function ahs to at the beginning, or function ahs to strat with {} etc.o
 2)easy to use
 3)we find many built in modules which help us doing our task much easier
 4)user friendly
 
For my project on data science analysising the data's have used analyser modules in python like:
  1)numpy module- for mathematical operations (like implementing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices etc.)
  2)pandas= for data structure or i can say the manupulation  of datas whicha re in tabular manner or in table. With this we can also read the file which we use for analysis and even we can creat a result/new file after anlysis etc.
  3)matplotlib- for graph of the result obtained
  4)seaborn also used for graph with the extra features like  violin plot etc which are not in matplot lib. i can say taht it is just built on top of matplotlib
  5)scipy.stats which is used to plot all the statistical graph and calculations
  
  for model training:(i have used in this project):
      for model training we us a kit called scikit learning which as all the required function that are related for training the model like regression, classifiction training to the model etc.
  1)Linear Regression- Which is a function in sklearn package which is use to know how a dependent variable depends on all independent variables present in the give set of data's. As well by suing fitting the mmodel we will train the model to learn how dependent variable depends on the indeoendent variable then it self have a regression line so that when we give a new data it see's where does the new data fits in and give us the value
        we use the fomula y=mx+c, where y is dependent variable, x an independent variable, m slop of the line obtained for y for each value on x, c a constant.
        
        
About Analysis:
Steps for analysis:
         1)I have used listing_summary datasheet for my analysis
         2)I have analysed for prediction of price of berline depending on reviews of different dimensions
         3) The dimensions i have considered are 'number_of_reviews','reviews_per_month','review_scores_value','review_scores_location','review_scores_communication','review_scores_checkin','review_scores_cleanliness','review_scores_rating','review_scores_accuracy'.
         4)Initially i have imported all the modules which are important for analysis
         5)reading the dataset and initializing it to a variable
         6)then looking at the null values and NaN values in the dataset , then  replacing it  with mean, median, mode for the column, zero etc depending on the dataset
         7)after the data is fit with null values we will take the columns which are required for the analysis
   
   
 Analysed for:
          1)VISIUALLY TO KNOW HOW THE BERLINE PRICE IS RELATED OR VARIED WITH RESPECT TO EACH DIMENSIONS
          2)Now finding the correlation between the dimensions and price
          3)Let us consider the room type and calculate the reviews average in all the dimensions
                    A)first calculating how many types of rrom type are there and total number of data related to it
                    B)Now calculating the total reviews based on the room types
                    C)Knowing the different property type and there count represented in the data set.
                    
                    
                    
  STILL MORE ANALYSIS WILL BE UPLOADED SHORTLY :)
